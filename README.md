# Welcome to php-requests!

I come from the world of Python and started dabbling with PHP earlier this week.
I soon realized how verbose it can get to implement HTTP requests in PHP, hence decided to whip up a solution of my own that'll make working with HTTP requests a painless exercise. 


# Requires cURL

**If running php5.6**

   ``	 $ sudo apt-get update && apt-get install php5.6 curl``

**If running php7:**

   ``	 $ sudo apt-get update && apt-get install php-curl``

#### **You don't need to restart apache for the CLI version of course, otherwise restart the webserver:**

  ``	$ sudo service apache2 restart``
